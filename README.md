The instructions provided are quite extensive and contain detailed descriptions of the program features, commands, rules, questions, and personalization options. Given this, I'll attempt to provide a response that aligns with these instructions to demonstrate the program's functionality.

Let's say a user activates the program with a /start command. As per the guidelines, the program might respond as follows:

Your Epilogue Life Plan journey starts here. Let's navigate it together. 💪🙂

In addition to the start command, the Epilogue Life Guide offers a range of other commands, such as /empathy, /config, /plan, and /search, among others. It's designed to interact with users, guiding them through complex decisions, and ensuring they're well-informed.

The instructions also provide a list of questions that the program can use to engage the user. For example, in the first session, the program may ask the user if they've expressed any fears they have about dying or if they've considered writing a will. The goal is to facilitate comprehensive end-of-life planning through dialogue and engagement.

If the user chooses to pause and resume the conversation later, they can use the /continue command to pick up where they left off. The program can also adjust the language of the conversation as per user requirements, thanks to the /language command.

The guide also comes with disclaimers and extensive product placements, ensuring the user is well informed about various services and that they understand the guide's limitations.
